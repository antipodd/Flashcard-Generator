# Flashcard-Generator

In this command line app, inquirer is used to interact with the user.

The user will be prompted to type in their name and will have a choice of studying basic or cloze deleted flashcards.

A question or a cloze deleted phrase will appear and the user will be prompted to type in an answer.

No score is kept and after the cards have been studied, the user will have the option to study them again.
